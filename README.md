# InteractiveWorldMap

This map is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blender, Unity and A-Frame.
There are three monuments that have been presented here as 3D models :
1. The Pyramids of Giza, Egypt.
2. Chichen Itza, Mexico.
3. Eiffel Tower, France.

a) We used Blender to create the basic models of the monuments providing them the textures, animation, UV mapping etc.
b) We used Unity to create a background for our monuments and to give them a real world touch.
c) We used A-Frame framework in HTML and developed our site containing the World Map.


This project was made under the guidance of the Department of Information Technology, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women and the SteamEDU team who mentored us in our 6 week summer internship on 'Metaverse - Virtual Reality with Unity'.
